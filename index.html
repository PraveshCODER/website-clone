    <h2 id="1">UPDATE</h2>
    I cloned one of these websites! I haven't built a website with pure html, css and js for a while, so I gave #14 <br>
    Discord a go. This is how it turned out. Not by best work, but I worked pretty fast! ü§£<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://cloned-discord-v1.netlify.app/"> Discord Cloned</a><br>
    <h2>Why clone websites?</h2>
    Frontend development has everything to do with the client side. Everything the user can see and interact with on
    <br>
    their web browser. <br><br>

    Studies show that if a website does not load within 2 seconds, users bounce. How do you think users react if a <br>
    website design is not up to par with modern designs and trends? <br><br>

    That being said, design has just as much importance as all the frontend programming going on in the background. <br>
    After all, developers are tasked to implement a professional design into a working website all the time. It's very
    <br>
    much an important piece of a frontend developers arsenal. Get good at it! <br><br>

    <h2 id="2">The goal</h2>
    Master this frontend skill, by cloning these websites as close to identical as possible. <br><br>

    Try to incorporate functionality, like modals and drop downs. Include responsive design, like mobile navigation, and
    <br>
    grids. <br><br>

    All websites listed below are similar, but just different enough to force different design concepts. For example,
    <br>
    majority of these websites have: <br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>Large homepage banners </li>
        <li>Big block designs</li>
        <li>Reversed grid columns</li>
        <li>Full or half page menus</li>
        <li>Sticky or absolute positioned navigations</li>
        <li> Galleries</li>
        <li>Dropdown / accordions</li>
        <li>Minor animations like fade, or type effects</li>
        <li>Two grid columns</li>
        <li>Responsive design and more!</li>
    </ol><br>
    <b>TIP:</b> You can also use web scrapers to download all the assets you find on websites. <br>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://extract.pics/">Extract Pics</a> <br>
    <a target="_blank"
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj">Image
        Downloader</a><br>

    <b>BONUS üî•</b><br>
    If you want to go full on leet mode, add javascript functionality. Like routing, dynamic content, 3rd party APIs
    (<br>
    i. google maps ) etc. <br><br>

    ‚ö†Ô∏è If you push your project up to the web, make sure to not claim your designs or assets as your own! <br><br>

        width="500" alt="netflix"><br>
    Netflix website section <br>
    When logged in Netflix is a pretty simple design. Horizontal rows, galleries, with a big featured banner. <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hulu.com/welcome"> 2. Hulu</a></h2><br>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dp7Wh0Oy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7sacyxwsukp01xybyrae.png"
        width="500" alt=""><br>
    Hulu website section <br>
    Just like Netflix, the logged in experience in Hulu is pretty similar. Has a large featured banner, and basically
    <br>
    rows of movies or tv shows with every few rows having a featured section. <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/"> 3. Apple</a></h2><br>

        width="500" alt=""><br>
    Apple website section <br>
    You'll know what I mean by "big block" design. Apple does this well. It's clean, intuitive and pretty straight <br>
    forward. If you break everything down into smaller components, you'll see how easy it would be to implement the <br>
    design. <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/"> 4. Airbnb</a></h2><br>

        width="500" alt=""><br>
    Airbnb website section <br>
    Airbnb is such a beautiful website! The assets are amazing. Break this design down into smaller components, and <br>
    you'll see how it's just a bunch of big rows and small rows. Blocks either spanning multiple columns, or the entire
    <br>
    row. <br><br>

        width="500" alt=""><br>
    Spacex website section <br>
    Super easy design. SpaceX is basically multiple fullscreen images with fade up content and a link section. <br><br>

        width="500" alt=""><br>
    NVIDIA website section <br>
    Another easy, but professional looking design. Just a banner, grid layout, and rows. <br><br>

        width="500" alt=""><br>
    Razer website section<br>
    A mix of a large home banner, full page featured sections, and big box design. Have fun with this sick color scheme!
    <br>

        alt=""><br>
    Blockchain website section <br>
    Learn about blockchain while you clone this one. This design incorporates a few more difficult design concepts. It
    <br>
    <br>
    also features a big banner, call to actions, gradient effects, but also has big box designs as links and dynamic
    <br>
    <br>
    accordions. So not only does the accordion tab drop more content below it, it changes the image beside it! You <br>
    probably have a tool of choice for this ü§î <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home"> 12. Paypal</a></h2><br>

        alt=""><br>
    Slack website section <br>
    Slack features a fun homepage banner. In the banner is a toast banner, a call to action, a google sign in button,
    <br>
    <br>
    and a row of icons featuring companies that use Slack. The rest of the layout is a simple grid system with a typical
    <br>
    <br>
    reverse row design. Minimal animations, like hover effects. <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/"> 14. Discord </a></h2><br>

        alt=""><br>
    Discord website section <br>
    Probably my favorite looking website on the list. It has fun vibrant colors, a minimalistic homepage banner <br>
    featuring a call to action, reverse row grid layout, and a nice big featured section. <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/"> 15. Amazon</a></h2><br>
    <img width="500"

        alt=""><br>
    Amazon website section<br>
    The king of e-commerce. This is a straight up "show off" mockup. If you can nail Amazons design, your frontend dev
    <br>
    <br>
    design skills are up to industry standard. Features a slightly more complex grid layout, with content spanning one
    <br>
    <br>
    or more rows and columns. Has a search bar in the navigation. Also has recommended section, hover effects, <br>
    carousels, etc. Have fun with this behemoth! <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/"> 16. Playstation</a></h2><br>
    <img width="500"

        alt=""><br>
    Playstation website section <br>
    Playstation.com has a nice large homepage banner featuring a slide show with a nice fade in effect. You can code
    <br>
    <br>
    this from scratch, or use your favorite library. Cloning website really gets you thinking about your tools. Also
    <br>
    <br>
    features single row gallery, large featured banners, dynamic content on click, multiple full screen call to actions,
    <br>
    <br>
    and minor animations. This is probably my second favorite looking website. Really enjoy the subtle animations and
    <br>

    <br>
    UI. It also really helps you polish multiple design concepts. <br><br>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/">17. Nintendo</a> </h2><br>
    <img width="500"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d8c5zIW4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/equfj9z84m2z88t1154h.png"
        alt=""><br>
    Nintendo website section <br>
    Ahhhh, childhood memories! Well, kind of, more of a Sega player. But I digress! Nintendo.com has a nice colorful
    <br>
    <br>
    homepage banner with a minimal call to action beneath it. Has a continuously scrolling single row gallery which is
    <br>
    <br>
    new on the list. So this will offer some great practice. Again, you can use a library for this as you don't need to
    <br>
    <br>
    re-create the wheel every time. Other than that, straight forward big box grid design and single row galleries. One
    <br>
    <br>
    row will help you practice "quick favoriting" items. <br><br>

    <h2 id="4">Conclusion! üòé</h2><br>
    That's a wrap on "Master Frontend Development üíª By Cloning These Websites üíØ" I really believe cloning one or <br>
    multiple of these website, will drastically improve your CSS. There's a lot of analytical thinking that comes with
    <br>
    <br>
    cloning websites, as you break down designs from larger to smaller components. And you also need to think about the
    <br>
    <br>
    best tools as you approach new problems. Then there is responsive design. A mobile or desktop first approach? For
    <br>
    <br>
    example, do you think Microsoft.com should prioritize the desktop or mobile experience? If it was up to me, I'd like
    <br>
    <br>
    to think most people wait till they can access a desktop to make very large purchases like desktops and laptops.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore I'd probably prioritize the desktop. This is a big part of a Frontend Developers job! Whether you're <br>
    freelancing or working for a company. Designs are either up to you, or by professional designers. Master this
    part<br>
    <br>
    of Frontend Development! <br><br>
